Currently, my website, including this blog, is generated from markdown files via Lume, a static site generator for Deno. The purpose of the blog is to share ideas and learn more about the subject of each post. Posts will be published even if they are incomplete, as I aim to explore topics with a broad scope.

For the moment, a static site generator such as Lume fits my needs (for the blog) because it makes it more convienent to update the blog's content, layout, features, etc. However, for the sake of simplicity and long-term access/maintenance, I plan to eventually migrate this blog to a simpler static site generator of my own making.
